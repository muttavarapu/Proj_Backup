    Your account may only be used by one person or legal entity.
    You are responsible for content posted and any activity that occurs under your account.
    We will not be liable for decisions you make or your actions beyond the scope of our products.
    You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including copyright or trademark laws).
    Our products are for your personal use. We work hard to provide you with a quality product and expect that you won't try to resell, copy, or make our products available to others without our written permission. If you love our product enough to pass it along, please just ask us for permission.

<h2>Our Services</h2>

    We consistently add to and improve our products and services. We may update, add, or remove products without prior notice.
    We strive to provide you with an exceptional customer experience and are always open to suggestions, comments, and feedback through our provided means of communication.
    We want you to learn and have fun doing so while using our products, however we can't guarantee this will be the case.
    We work diligently to make sure our products and services are available and reliable. Because of the nature of our business, this is not something we can always control or guarantee.

<h2>Enrollment</h2>

Individual Code School subscriptions are referred to as "Individual Enrollment" and group subscriptions as "Team Enrollment".

    A valid credit card or properly pre-approved PayPal account is required for payment.
    The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis, as determined by your initial enrollment date. That date may shift over time due to the different lengths of months.
    All enrollment plans are automatically renewed unless customers preemptively deactivate their enrollment, which can be done from their Account page.
    All enrollment fees exclude all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.
    When seats are added to an enrolled team a pro-rated charge for the new seats will be made immediately based on the remaining number of days in your current billing cycle. The full seat price will only be charged when the enrollment is next renewed.
    Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. Code School doesn't accept any liability for such loss.

<h2>Cancellation and Deactivation</h2>

    You are responsible for properly canceling your subscription. You can do so at any time by clicking on the "My Account" link in the navigation at the top of the screen. The subscription section allows you to "deactivate" your subscription temporarily or indeterminately.
    If you deactivate your subscription before the end of your current billing cycle, your cancellation will be effective on the day the next cycle is set to start. In the meantime, you will retain access to our Service.
    Code School, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other Code School service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account. Code School reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
